=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the Pardot REST API to retrieve an existing prospect. To 
    configure the info values, you'll need your email, password, and a user key. 
    This key can be found in your account settings under the description of API 
    User Key. After configuring the handler, the email will then be used to 
    query Pardot and retrieve the prospect associated with the provided email.
    If the email does not exist, the handler will still return the results, 
    except all of the results will be empty. So the easiest way to check if a 
    prospect exists is to see if an id successfully returned.
