=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the Pardot REST API to create a new prospect. To configure
    the info values, you'll need your email, password, and a user key. This key
    can be found in your account settings under the description of API User Key.
    After configuring the handler, all the information can then be used to send
    and API call to Pardot to create a new prospect. If the Assign To parameter
    is left blank, the new prospect will be assigned to the user that is
    authenticated in the info values. If you want to assign a different user,
    include an email address in the Assign To parameter. This will cause 2 other
    API calls to be kicked off, one that reassigns the user from the info values
    and another one that then assigns the user from the Assign To parameter.
